    "## We should give a dam\n",
    "\n",
    "Many scientists believe we may be on the cusp of the sixth Mass Extinction in Earth’s history, due to human impact on the environment (1). Since the early 20th Century the majority of major rivers around the globe have been impounded or diverted to harness the power of water for energy production, transportation, flood control, water storage, and even recreation (2, 3). Although we as a society benefit greatly from the construction of these engineering marvels, dams have a dramatic impact on river ecosystems. A dam drastically slows water flow, trapping sediment, fish, and water upstream as the reservoir fills flooding the river valley. As a result both the river habitats and the riparian habitats are lost. Downstream of the dam water flow is strictly controlled, often eliminating the natural annual cycles of flooding that supplied sediment and nutrients to the floodplain. When water flow exceeds the storage capacity of the dam, the water released often causes catastrophic flooding downstream. Even as the water rushes out the necessary sediment, nutrients, and organisms are for the most part still trapped behind the dam. Finally dam construction alters the aesthetics of beautiful landscapes around the world and threatening freshwater and terrestrial species (4). Thousands of new dams are proposed globally that will potential impact protected areas such as National Parks, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and Ramsar Sites adjacent to rivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is being undertaken in collaboration with the World Wildlife Foundation for the purpose of identifying critical habitats that will potentially be impacted by future dam construction through the analysis of existing datasets. "

    "## Gathering the Data\n",
    "Various organizations and researchers have gathered information about our river around the globe that we have leveraged to identify protected areas that are downstream from proposed dams.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Free Flowing Rivers\n",
    "This database contains hydrographic information for all major rivers across the globe. Of particular interest for this work is the Degree of Regulation (DOR) was calculated for each river reach in the database.  DOR is an index that represents how water storage behind a dam will impact the flow of river reaches downstream.  It is reported as a percent, where 0% is a free flowing river and 100% is a reach where the flow is completely altered by a dam.\n",

    "### Current and Future Dam Database\n",
    "Global Dam Watch, a collaboration between NGOs and academic institutions, has created and made publicly available three databases that document current and proposed large dams (capacity of >....)across the globe. http://globaldamwatch.org/data/\n",

    "## Asking the Right Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulling all these data sets together allows us to start asking where are new dams going to be built? And how many protected areas are close enough to these dams to potentially be affected? \n",
    "\n",
    "First we overlayed the river reaches (a segment of river channel between two junctions with other channels) that currently have some Degree of Regulation (DOR) with the protected areas (Figure 1). In order to compare the magnitude of regulation the data was divided into group - < 5%, 5-10%, 10-15%, 15-20%, and over 20%.  All river reaches with a DOR of 0% are excluded from these images. Then we hid all river reaches that did not correspond with a protected area (Figure 2). Finally we subtracted the current DOR value from the proposed dam DOR value to find out which areas would have an increase in regulation (Figure 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "(We need to expand our explanation and possibly use fewer maps to illustrate the process, depends on what we decide to communicate. Do we want to include more of the process of data analysis, i.e. how to make the sausage)"
