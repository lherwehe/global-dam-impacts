    "### Goals\n",
    "This project aims to understand how proposed dams could affect protected areas globally by (1) analyzing proposed dams by continent, (2) providing functions that combine protected areas datasets to create full datasets of protected areas by region, (3) calculating the difference between current and future degree of regulation for global rivers that overlap protected areas, (4) calculating the total length of rivers on protected lands and total area of protected lands that are affected by proposed dams by country, and (5) creating data visualizations of rivers by degree of regulation paired with protected areas."

    "### Relevance\n",
    "Dam construction over the past century has dramatically altered our landscapes, threatening ecosystems and endangered species around the world. Thousands of new dams are proposed globally that would affect protected areas such as National Parks, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and United Nations Ramsar Sites. While data is publicly available, there is scant understanding of how these proposed dams will affect these critical protected areas. \n",
